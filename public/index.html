        <h3>Select story type: horror story. Prompt:cat and dog friendship</h3>
        <h3>Output:</h3>
        <p>Horror story: cat and dog friendship: Bartholomew the Basset Hound had eyes like melted licorice and a
          mournful sigh that could curdle milk. He was, to put it mildly, melancholic. So, when Mittens, a Siamese with
          eyes the color of frozen sapphires, took to lurking in his doghouse, Bartholomew was initially horrified.
          Mittens wasn't normal. She didn't purr, she clicked. Her meow sounded like wind chimes in a graveyard. And she
          had a disconcerting habit of staring just behind Bartholomew's head, a faint smile playing on her
          whisker-twitching lips. Their friendship began oddly. One twilight, Bartholomew noticed Mittens meticulously
          arranging dead crickets in a circle around his water bowl. "What are you doing?" he whined, the question a
          guttural rumble in his chest. Mittens clicked. "A ward. To keep the shadows away. They hunger, you know."
          Bartholomew didn't know. But he trusted Mittens, the way one trusts the only other creature who understands
          the chilling drafts whispering through the house at night. Their days became a grotesque ballet. Mittens would
          lead Bartholomew on hunts through the overgrown garden, pointing out the twitching, half-formed earthworms
          with a flick of her tail. He'd dig them up, not to eat, but to bury them deeper, ensuring they didn't escape
          the earth's hungry embrace. One night, Bartholomew woke to find Mittens staring, truly staring, at him.
          "Tonight," she clicked, her voice like ice shattering. "The shadows come for you." He whimpered, burying his
          face in his paws. Then, a voice, not his, not Mittens', but a chorus of rustling leaves and cracking bones,
          whispered from the darkness: "We have waited long enough." Bartholomew looked up. Mittens was gone. Only the
          scent of damp earth and the faint echo of wind chimes remained. He was alone. And the shadows, finally, were
          home.</p>
